# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## What's Been Configured

Your TindeRestaurant app has been configured for GitHub Pages deployment with the following changes:

### 1. Package.json Updates

- Added `gh-pages` and `copy-webpack-plugin` as dev dependencies
- Added deployment scripts:
  - `predeploy`: Runs build automatically before deploy
  - `deploy`: Deploys built files to GitHub Pages
- Set homepage URL: `https://mpmisha.github.io/TindeResturant`

### 2. Webpack Configuration

- Updated `publicPath` for production to `/TindeResturant/`
- Added CopyWebpackPlugin to copy GitHub Pages files
- Configured to copy `404.html` and `.nojekyll` files

### 3. GitHub Pages Setup Files

- Created `public/404.html` - Handles React Router routing on GitHub Pages
- Created `public/.nojekyll` - Prevents Jekyll processing
- Updated `public/index.html` - Added SPA redirect script

## Deployment Process

The `npm run deploy` command will:

1. Build the production version (`npm run build`)
2. Deploy to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository
3. GitHub will automatically serve the site from this branch

## After Deployment

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/mpmisha/TindeResturant
2. Navigate to Settings > Pages
3. Ensure Source is set to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select the `gh-pages` branch
5. Your site will be available at: https://mpmisha.github.io/TindeResturant

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment fails:

- Check GitHub repository permissions
- Ensure you're logged into git: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
- Ensure git email is set: `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`
- Make sure you have push access to the repository
- Manually enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

## Commands to Run After Setup
