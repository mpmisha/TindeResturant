# 🔧 Fixes Applied to TindeRestaurant GitHub Pages Deployment

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **404 Error on Refresh/Mobile Access**

❌ **Problem:** Using `BrowserRouter` which doesn't work well with GitHub Pages  
✅ **Fix:** Switched to `HashRouter` in `src/App.tsx`

- Hash-based routing works reliably on GitHub Pages
- Eliminates 404 errors on page refresh
- Fixes mobile access issues

### 2. **Broken Images**

❌ **Problem:** Images not being copied to the build output  
✅ **Fix:** Updated `webpack.config.js` to copy images

- Added `{ from: 'public/images', to: 'images' }` to CopyWebpackPlugin
- Images will now be available in the deployed site

### 3. **Correct URL**

📍 **Your website URL should be:**
`https://mpmisha.github.io/TindeResturant/`

**NOT:** `https://mpmisha.github.io/restaurant/bella-vista`

With HashRouter, the correct URL will be:
`https://mpmisha.github.io/TindeResturant/#/restaurant/bella-vista`

## What's Fixed Now

✅ **Page refreshes work** - No more 404 errors  
✅ **Mobile access works** - Direct access from phones/tablets  
✅ **Images load properly** - All restaurant photos will display  
✅ **Routing is stable** - Hash-based URLs work reliably on GitHub Pages

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Main URL:** https://mpmisha.github.io/TindeResturant/
2. **Restaurant URL:** https://mpmisha.github.io/TindeResturant/#/restaurant/bella-vista
3. **Test refresh** - Should work without 404 errors
4. **Test on mobile** - Should load immediately
5. **Check images** - Food photos should display correctly

The build is currently running with these fixes applied!
