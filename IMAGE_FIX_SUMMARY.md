# üñºÔ∏è Image Loading Fix Applied

## Problem Identified

- ‚ùå **All dish images were returning 404 errors**
- ‚ùå **App was falling back to placeholder images for all dishes**
- ‚ùå **Images existed but weren't loading due to incorrect paths**

## Root Cause

The image paths were missing the GitHub Pages base path `/TindeResturant/`.

**Incorrect paths (causing 404s):**

```
https://mpmisha.github.io/images/dishes/bella-vista/chianti-wine.jpg
```

**Correct paths (after fix):**

```
https://mpmisha.github.io/TindeResturant/images/dishes/bella-vista/chianti-wine.jpg
```

## Solution Implemented

### Updated `src/utils/restaurantLoader.ts`:

1. **Added `getBasePath()` function:**
   - Detects GitHub Pages environment (`mpmisha.github.io`)
   - Returns `/TindeResturant` for production
   - Returns empty string for local development

2. **Updated `PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE` path:**

   ```typescript
   export const PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE = `${getBasePath()}/images/placeholders/dish-placeholder.jpg`;
   ```

3. **Updated `getImageWithFallback()` function:**
   ```typescript
   const basePath = getBasePath();
   return `${basePath}/images/dishes/${restaurantId}/${imagePath}`;
   ```

## What's Fixed Now

‚úÖ **All dish images will load correctly** on GitHub Pages  
‚úÖ **Placeholder images work as fallbacks** when needed  
‚úÖ **Local development still works** (no base path locally)  
‚úÖ **Environment detection** automatically handles the correct paths

## Available Dish Images

Your app has images for all these dishes:

- Chianti wine, Italian soda, Espresso
- Bruschetta, Antipasto, Caprese salad
- Carbonara, Margherita pizza, Osso buco, Seafood risotto
- Tiramisu, Gelato trio, Cannoli

## Testing After Deployment

Once the deployment completes:

1. **Visit:** `https://mpmisha.github.io/TindeResturant/`
2. **Check images:** All dish photos should now display correctly
3. **Test swiping:** Each dish should show its actual image, not placeholder
4. **Verify fallbacks:** Placeholder should only appear if image truly doesn't exist

The deployment is currently running with this fix applied!
